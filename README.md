# Real and Synthetic JLTV Vehicle Dataset
Abstract
	
Access to synthetic data is crucial for developing effective artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (ML) models. Real-world data often poses significant challenges, including privacy, availability, and bias. To mitigate these challenges, synthetic datasets can be leveraged. This article explores the efficacy of synthetic datasets in training state-of-the-art object detection models, specifically focusing on the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV). Using the powerful Unreal Engine, which can create highly realistic scenes, we generated a comprehensive synthetic dataset designed to simulate real-world conditions and enhance the training process for various detection algorithms

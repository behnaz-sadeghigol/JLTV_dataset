# BSRG:Bridging the Synthetic-to-Real Gap: Creating Simulated Datasetsfor Domain Adaptation to Enhance Vehicle Detection


## Overview
<p style="font-size:30px; ">To create our synthetic dataset, we harnessed the capabilities of Unreal Engine Our process involved meticulously constructing a virtual scene that accurately represented the JLTV military machine. This scene included intricate geometry, realistic materials, and precise lighting conditions.By driving the simulated JLTV across five distinct environments (forest, pasture, mountain, snow, and plain) and rendering on it, we generated a diverse set of synthetic data samples. Our Unreal Engine generated synthetic dataset comprises 3043 samples, with 130 reserved for validation and 2913 for training. </p>
 

## Features

ðŸ§ ** Render annotations for semantic segmentation, instance segmentation and panoptic segmentation**.

ðŸ“Š **Evaluate and visualize data**. Compare the synthetic data to the real data against a variety of measures. Diagnose problems and generate a quality report to get more insights.

ðŸ”„ **Preprocess, anonymize and define constraints**. Control data processing to improve the quality of synthetic data, choose from different types of anonymization and define business rules in the form of logical constraints.

## Introduction

<p style="font-size:40px; "> Oshkosh Defense has supplied over 22,000 Joint Light Tactical Vehicles [JLTV](https://oshkoshdefense.com/vehicles/light-tactical-vehicles/jltv) to the United States military and allied foreign governments. The JLTV, designed for improved performance, payload, and protection, is a specialized vehicle not widely available in many countries. Obtaining a comprehensive real-world dataset for JLTV object detection is challenging. However, the existence of the JLTV model in the Unreal Engine marketplace provides an opportunity to leverage synthetic data generation. Creating a synthetic JLTV dataset in Unreal Engine allows access to a diverse set of labeled data for training and validating object recognition models. This approach is particularly valuable for rare or specialized objects, overcoming real-world data limitations. After generating the synthetic dataset, a real labeled dataset collected from the Internet and manually annotated using the CVAT[5] tool. This combination of synthetic and real-world data can be useful for domain matching, which is the process of adapting a model trained in one domain (such as synthetic data) to perform well in a different domain (such as real-world data)[6]. By using synthetic and real-world data, you can improve the performance and robustness of your object recognition model. The creation of a synthetic JLTV dataset, combined with real-world data, demonstrates a practical approach to addressing data availability challenges in specialized domains. Researchers and practitioners working on object detection tasks, especially in scenarios with scarce real-world data, can benefit from this methodology. </p>

[JLTV Dataset](https://github.com/behnaz-sadeghigol/sadeghigol/blob/main) is an open-source, developer-first way to anonymize PII, generate synthetic data and sync environments for better testing, debugging and developer experience.

JLTV dataset use to:

**Safely test code against production data** - Anonymize sensitive production data in order to safely use it locally for a better testing and developer experience

**Easily reproduce production bugs locally** - Anonymize and subset production data to get a safe, representative data set that you can use to locally reproduce production bugs quickly and efficiently

**High quality data for lower-level environments** - Catch bugs before they hit production when you hydrate your staging and QA environments with production-like data

**Seed development databases** - Easily seed development databases with synthetic data for unit testing, demos and more

You can publish your file by opening the **Publish** sub-menu and by clicking **Publish to**. For some locations, you can choose between the following formats:

- Markdown: publish the Markdown text on a website that can interpret it (**GitHub** for instance),
- HTML: publish the file converted to HTML via a Handlebars template (on a blog for example).

# Real and Synthetic JLTV Vehicle Dataset

## Overview

The Synthetic JLTV Data (SJD) is a Python library designed to be your one-stop shop for creating tabular synthetic data. The SDV uses a variety of machine learning algorithms to learn patterns from your real data and emulate them in synthetic data.

## Features

ðŸ§ ** Render annotations for semantic segmentation, instance segmentation and panoptic segmentation**.

ðŸ“Š **Evaluate and visualize data**. Compare the synthetic data to the real data against a variety of measures. Diagnose problems and generate a quality report to get more insights.

ðŸ”„ **Preprocess, anonymize and define constraints**. Control data processing to improve the quality of synthetic data, choose from different types of anonymization and define business rules in the form of logical constraints.

## Introduction

Deep neural network based military vehicle detectors pose particular challenges due to the scarcity of relevant images and limited access to vehicles in this domain. Moreover, Real-world data often poses significant challenges, including privacy, availability, and bias. To mitigate these challenges, synthetic datasets can be leveraged. This article explores the efficacy of synthetic datasets in training state-of-the-art object detection models, specifically focusing on the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle [JLTV](https://oshkoshdefense.com/vehicles/light-tactical-vehicles/jltv/). Using the powerful Unreal Engine, which can create highly realistic scenes, we generated a comprehensive synthetic dataset designed to simulate real-world conditions and enhance the training process for various detection algorithms

[JLTV Dataset](https://github.com/behnaz-sadeghigol/sadeghigol/blob/main) is an open-source, developer-first way to anonymize PII, generate synthetic data and sync environments for better testing, debugging and developer experience.

JLTV dataset use to:

**Safely test code against production data** - Anonymize sensitive production data in order to safely use it locally for a better testing and developer experience

**Easily reproduce production bugs locally** - Anonymize and subset production data to get a safe, representative data set that you can use to locally reproduce production bugs quickly and efficiently

**High quality data for lower-level environments** - Catch bugs before they hit production when you hydrate your staging and QA environments with production-like data

**Seed development databases** - Easily seed development databases with synthetic data for unit testing, demos and more

You can publish your file by opening the **Publish** sub-menu and by clicking **Publish to**. For some locations, you can choose between the following formats:

- Markdown: publish the Markdown text on a website that can interpret it (**GitHub** for instance),
- HTML: publish the file converted to HTML via a Handlebars template (on a blog for example).
